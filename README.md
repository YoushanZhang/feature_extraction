# This tutorial shows the transfer learning of pre-trained ImageNet models using dog and cat images
1. We first extract pre-trained features from the ResNet50 model
2. We then visualize these features using the t-SNE view
3. We train a traditional SVM classifier using five-fold cross-validation to classify these features


Below is one related work of extracting features from AlexNet and classifying them using SVM
